# turtle-python
An enormous collection of Python Turtle codes. Contribute yours too, and help open-source!

Our target is to create the largest hosted repo containing python turtle designs!

- "turtles" directory contains designs with their .py codes and .jpg images
- "turtles-colab" directory contains designs in colab format, along with its .jpg output.
