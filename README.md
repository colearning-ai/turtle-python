# turtle-python
An enormous collection of Python Turtle codes. Contribute yours too, and help open-source!

Our target is to create the largest hosted repo containing python turtle designs!

- "turtles" directory contains designs with their .py codes and .jpg images
- "turtles-colab" directory contains designs in colab format, along with its .jpg output.

## Read our contributions.md to know more!

[Read the turtle docs here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle)

#### Contributers are requested to cite their code source in python code comments if the code is taken from other source. We at Colearning.ai believe to create a positive learning atmosphere.
