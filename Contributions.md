# How to contribute? 

IF you want to contribute in existing codes:
- Create a PR, with explaining the issue/ code change in not more than 50 words.
- PRs to existing codes will only count if you speed up the process. Our target is to create turtle design with the fastest possible mode.

If you want to contribute a new code/design of turtle:
- Create a PR to our "turtles" directory in a folder, containing two files: .py file containing the python code of turtle module, and one .png/.jpg image of the final output of the turtle design.
- We have a seperate folder as turtles-colab for all the designs made in .ipynb format. We would like to have them too. You can even have the exiisting codes of .py fles and convert and upload it's colab version in the "turtles-colab" folder in a PR.
